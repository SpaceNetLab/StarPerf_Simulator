Function : This script is used to simulate the constellation working in bent-pipe mode, and there is no ISL between
           satellites.

Specific implementation: The constellation has generated various shells, orbits, and satellites during initialization.
                         There is no ISL between satellites in this mode, so there is nothing to do here, just return
                         directly.
