Function : This script is used to calculate the length of time that a user on the ground can see the satellite.
           The lowest elevation angle that the user can see of the satellite is θ, the orbital height of the satellite
           is h (unit: kilometers), and the radius of the earth is R (unit: kilometers). Calculate the length of time
           from when the user can see the satellite to when the user cannot see the satellite based on the given parameters.
